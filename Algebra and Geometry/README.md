# Algebra and Geometry
Many of the programs here can be used in both Geometry and Algebra, so I
didn't think it necessary to separate them. Here's a breakdown of all the
programs here:

### DISTANCE
The distance formula for two points in 2 dimensional space. Prompts the
user for the x and y coordinates of both points, then returns the distance
between them.

### PYTHON
It may be a confusing name, but shortening Pythagorean other ways sounded
too much like a slur. This function takes the length of sides A and B of
a triangle and returns the hypotenuse, C. This only works for right 
triangles, so the program will assume the triangle is a right triangle. 
It will detect side lengths equal to or less than 0, as no triangle can 
have those side lengths. 

### QUAD
The quadratic formula. User inputs coefficients, and both solutions are
printed. 

### STANDARD
Turns an equation from standard form to slope-intercept form. One of the
few times I had the output take the form of a fraction instead of a
decimal.
