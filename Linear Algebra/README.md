# Linear Algebra
"Go by the name of 'Vector.' It's a mathematical term; a quantity 
represented by an arrow with both direction and magnitude."

Functions here will largely deal with matrices and vectors. 

### BESTFT
Related to line of best fit: this function finds the closest 
solution to b (p) for an inconsistent system. Create matrices 
[A] and [B] first (must have the same number of rows: A should
be mxn, B should be mx1). Stores answer to a new matrix [G].
[G] is an augmented matrix- the last column is the solution.
